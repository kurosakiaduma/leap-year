# Leap year calculator
This is a webpage that finds out whether a year that the user inputs is a leap year.

## About
The project is basically a study of getting the concept of a BDD skills(Behavior Driven Development).

The specs for the program logic are:
1. The program should return when a year is not a leap year.
Input Example: 1993
Output Example: false

1. The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 4, since those are leap years.
Input Example: 2004
Output Example: true
1. The program should return 'false' for years divisible by 100, since those are not leap years.
Input Example: 1900
Output Example: false
1. The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 400, since those are leap years.
Input Example: 2000
Output Example: true

The back-end logic format for the program determines whether years are divisible by **4** OR **100** AND **400** using a for Loop function and refactoring the parameters.
